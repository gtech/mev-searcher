# MEV-Searcher

A historical artifact of a liquidation bot.

Partial implementation of $10-150 million projected net gain prior to the 3CRV USDT depeg on the Alpha Homora Protocol.

This was built when Flashbots first came out and frontran all other bots on the Liquity protocol. It achieved $168k in liquidations with a $2k net profit.

The repo contains the reverse engineering of Alpha Homora protocol obfuscated math.
